/**
 * Chapter: 5
 * Exercise: 5-13 - Write the program tail, which prints the last n lines of its input. By default, n is 10, let us say,
 * but it can be changed by an optional argument, so that tail -n prints the last n lines. The program should behave rationally
 * no matter how unreasonable the input or the value of n. Write the program so it makes the best use of available storage;
 * lines should be stored as in the sorting program of Section 5.6, not in a two-dimensional array of fixed size.
