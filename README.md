## The C Programming Language

This repository contains the _solutions_ to the exercises from each chapter of the book, these solutions are meant to be helpful for those who want to learn to program with the C language.

The first C programming book “The C Programming Language” was published in 1978, written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. With the rapid growth of the C language for several years, it was time to standardize the language and are also known as ANSI C. The focus of the book is the C programming language, however, the approach is general, so it can be extended to all programming languages.

### Notes

> **Note:** Most input functions are terminated by EOF, for programs reading from stdin, you will need to hit CTRL-D twice to exit if the last character entered was not a newline, this behavior is defined by the POSIX standard (see this  [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21260674/why-do-i-need-to-type-ctrl-d-twice-to-mark-end-of-file?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa)).

> **Test Files** The test data files are provided to support manually testing the exercises. Specifically, the ones that draw from standard input can be manually tested with these. There are some files that i used for test and a instruction to how use it.

>**Version:** The code was written according to the **C99** standard, published in 2011.
